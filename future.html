					<ul class="future-list">
						<li><strong>Improving my academic UX vocabulary.</strong> I feel like I have an intuitive understanding of UX, largely based of my professional experience, but I’d love to have more of the academic underpinnings too.</li>
						<li><strong>Building empathy and better human products.</strong> I need to get out of my own head more often and look at how real humans use digital products. While I know that my level of familiarity with tech is above average, that awareness doesn’t always organically flow into my work.</li>
						<li><strong>CSS and HTML wizardry.</strong> I can do a lot with CSS and HTML but I want to explore the cutting edge and push expectorations for web-based design (and to be able to pass that mastery onto my students).

					<h2>Long Term</h2>
					<h3>Academically speaking</h3>
					<p>Being in the early stages of my post-graduate academic journey it’s a bit daunting to think that the decisions that I make in the next years will shape the next phase of my career. UX, education, happiness, social networks, opt-in marketing, consumer choice and control – somewhere in there is the niche that I want to carve. For this my academic research and writing skills definitely need sharpening.</p>
					<h3>Professionally speaking</h3>
					<p>Even if academia does become my ‘thing’, I feel like it would benefit me to keep some sort of professional practice going. Getting to a point where I really have the freedom to pick and choose the projects that I get involved in is definitely a goal. </p>

					<h2>Pet Projects</h2>
					<p>I have three (ok, so like 9 or 100) ideas that continue to roll around in the back of my head, but the three that I would love to turn into reality at some stage:</p>
					<ul class="project-list">
						<li>An online program for small business owners that teaches the ins-and-outs of websites</li>
						<li>An online application that teaches better recycling habits – specific to the local area that the participant is in.</li>
						<li>A small agency that hires final-year design students (for the year) to give them paid, practical, hands-on experience.</li>
